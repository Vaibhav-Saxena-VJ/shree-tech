                <h3>Features -</h3>

                <p class="product-description">
                A burner controller system is designed to control the air supply to a burner, as well as the temperature and flow of fuel. Burner controls are used in industries such as steel, petrochemical, and chemical plants. It is a type of industrial control system that is used to regulate the flow of natural gas or other fuel through a burner.
                </p>

                <p class="product-description">
                Burner Controller are designed to provide the best performance and reliability for their applications. They perform a wide range of functions, such as regulating gas flow, controlling flame height and temperature, and monitoring combustion conditions. These Controls are available in many different models depending on their application. Some models provide additional features like flame safety shut-off, flame monitoring, and flame extinction.
                </p>

                <p class="product-description">
                These are used in industries such as steel, mining, oil and gas, and cement to regulate the amount of air fed to a burner. There are many different types of Burner Controls that come with different features. Some Burner Controls have a PID controller which is a type of feedback loop that constantly adjusts the flame’s output until it reaches its set point.
                </p>

                <p>
                Other Burner Controller are designed for accuracy and to run continuously with minimal changes. Burner Controls come in a range of sizes and can be purchased for different applications. There are three basic types of Burner Controls-

                <!-- Product Additional Info -->
                <ul class="product-additional-info">
                    <li><strong>Pilot</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Master, and</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Slave controllers</strong></li>
                </ul>             

                <p class="product-description">
                A pilot controller has a single burner, making it easier to control the flame’s output. A master controller regulates the output of a larger number of burners and is controlled by a potential electrical signal. A slave controller can only be controlled by a master controller, but it is easier to install and use than the master controller, because it can control a larger number of burners with a single input from the user.
                </p>
                <h3>Applications:</h3>

                <p class="product-description">
                Industrial Burner Controller are used in industries like petrochemical, refining, oil and gas, and power generation. They are used to regulate the flow of fuel to burners which produce heat for various purposes. They are used in the process of boosting the temperature and pressure at all levels of an industrial combustion system.
                </p>
                <p class="product-description">
                BCU/IFD/IFS/UVS/UVC Kromschroder Burner Controller have many benefits for the organisation that uses them. They can save money by reducing fuel consumption, reduce emissions into the air, increase efficiency by using less energy and provide better control of process conditions.
                </p>
                <h3> Benefits :</h3>
                <p class="product-description">
                Burner Controls are the most effective way to control the combustion in the furnace. These controls are used to maintain a constant temperature and reduce emissions. It is a type of valve used to control the flow of air and fuel in a furnace.
                </p>
                <p class="product-description">
                Industrial burners can be controlled with three types of valves: Combustion, air and fuel. Combustion valves control the air-fuel ratio by adjusting how much air is mixed with fuel. Air valves control the amount of air that is mixed with fuel, while fuel valves control how much fuel is mixed with air.
